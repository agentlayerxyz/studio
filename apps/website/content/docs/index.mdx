# Introduction

## What is AgentStudio?

AgentStudio is a set of tools and services maintained by [AgentLayer](https://agentlayer.xyz) as an effort to make it easier to build, test, and deploy AI agents. It embodies the best practices we've learned from building and operating production-grade AI agents and our vision for the future of AI agent development.

From a high level perspective, AgentStudio is a collection of the following tools:

- **AgentStudio Core**: Core definitions and abstractions for AI agents and multi-agent runtime.
- **AgentStudio APIs & SDKs**: A set of APIs and SDKs providing essential functionalities that AI agents rely on to interact with the world.
- **AgentStudio MCP**: A Model Context Protocol server that packed the tools and resources in a standardized fashion, making it easier to integrate with various MCP hosts.
- **AgentStudio UI**: A web-based UI for effortless building and managing your AI agents and AgentStudio projects.

We are releasing all of these components as open-source software under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). 

Some of these components are still in the early stages of development and we are still working on polishing them. We will be making them available gradually as we are confident with their stability and capabilities. Meanwhile, any feedback and contributions are more than welcome!

## What is AgentLayer?

AgentLayer is a next-generation protocol designed to enhance AI agent functionality with scalable and secure blockchain technology. It consists of four primary components:

- **AgentNetwork**: A high-performance blockchain infrastructure with cross-chain capabilities.
- **AgentStudio**: Enterprise-grade tools for developing multimodal AI agents.
- **Agent Launchpad -- PumpAgent**: An Automated Market Maker (AMM) that enables transparent agent token trading.
- **AgentLink**: A sophisticated communication and orchestration framework that facilitates multi-agent collaboration.

AgentLayer is a firm believer that the blockchain technology plays a crucial role in the future of AI agent development, especially in terms of the agent's ownership, credibility and autonomy.
